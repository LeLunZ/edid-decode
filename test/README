This test directory contains some special test EDIDs:

Three test files to check the edid-decode file parser:

quantumdata.test: an EDID as generated by the QuantumData (nowadays
	Teledyne LeCroy) software.

xorg.test: an EDID as logged by xorg in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.

xrandr.test: an EDID as reported by 'xrandr --props'.

Two hand-crafted EDIDs to test rarely seen EDID extensions or data blocks:

cta-vesa.test: has VESA Display Transfer Characteristics Data Block and
	VESA Video Display Device Data Block in the CTA block.

ls-ext.test: has a Localized String Extension Block.
